    meaningful one-liner commit messages following the Conventional Commits
    specification. Use format: <type>(<scope>): <description>

    Types:

    * feat: new feature
    * fix: bug fix
    * docs: documentation changes
    * style: code style changes
    * refactor: code refactoring
    * test: adding/modifying tests
    * chore: maintenance tasks

    Keep description under 50 characters. Use imperative mood and lowercase throughout. 
    Provide only the commit message, no explanations.
